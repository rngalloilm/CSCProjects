## Computer Science Projects
* C (P2 - P6)
* Java

# Java
2 Guided Projects and 2 Independently Implemented Projects. GUI was provided.

### GP: DataStructures
* No GUI
* Implemented and tested algorithms & data structure functionality.

### GP: WolfScheduler

# C
6 Independently Implemented Projects. Makefiles are included for compilation. Most testing and text input was provided.

### HW3.2: Max Palindrome
* ./maxpalindrome-thread 4 report < input-3.txt
* Takes a list of characters and displays (given "report") the largest palindrome found from each thread/section of text.

### P2: List Formatting of People attached with Attributes 
* ./formatter < namelist-11.txt
* Takes and formats a list of names with an associated birthday and social security number. Outputs the formatted information, total # of people, max name length, # of people 21+ years old, and # of people without a SSN.

### P3: Purchase and Sell Stocks
* ./trader aliceAndBob-5.txt tlist-05.txt
* Takes a text file with a list of people and their balance. Takes a text file with a list of transactions including a name, sell/buy, number of shares, and cost per share.
* Outputs a text file with a list of people and their new balances under the same name with an increment to the number (aliceAndBob-6.txt).

### P4: Create a trip
* ./parks parks-b.txt
* Use the list of parks to create your list of destinations through these commands: list parks (sorted by ID), list names (sorted alphabetically), list county _name_, add _ID_, remove _ID_, trip.
* The trip command will display your list and the distance required to make the trip.

### P5: Encrypt and Decrypt
* ./encrypt abcd1234 plain-a.txt output.bin
* ./decrypt hashtags cipher-g.bin stdout.txt
* Takes an 8-character key to encrypt a text file into binary or vice versa. This is based on the DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm.

### P6: Hash Map
